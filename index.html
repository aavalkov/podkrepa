						<h3>Kabile @ Podkrepa Hall</h3>
						<h4>October 12, Thursday 7: 30 PM</h4>
						<h4>Potluck - $20 at the door</h4>
						<h4>Please join us and help support live Bulgarian music and dancing!</h4>
						<p>One of Bulgaria's premier wedding bands is returning for another U.S. tour this fall! This multi-talented group of musicians from Thrace, in southern Bulgaria, played together
						for nearly 20 years until two key members immigrated to the U.S.in 1995. In late 2007, the two émigrés returned to Bulgaria to record a reunion CD - Kabile - Traditional Music From Thrace with their former band members.
						Kabile was formed in 1978 and became one of the most popular bands in Thrace. Based in the city of Yambol, the group took its name from the village of Kabile, where they performed one of their earliest gigs.The group specialized in performing native music on traditional village instruments. During its heyday, the band played almost every weekend at weddings, baptisms and cultural festivals in Thrace.</p>
						<p>The members of the band are Dzhenko Andreev(gaida), Ivan Handzhiev(vocals, accordion), Nikolay Doktorov(kaval), Nikolay Kolev(gadulka), and Donka Koleva(vocals).</p>
						<p>We warmly welcome them back to Portland!</p>

								<h3><i>Playing ‘Til Your Soul Comes Out - A Smithsonian Folkways Recording</i><br/>
								Photographs and recordings by Martin Koenig</h3>
								<h4>Artist Talk and Dance: Saturday, October 21, 2017, 6:00pm</h4>
								<p>Over fifty years ago, Martin Koenig embarked on a trip to the Balkans that would transform his life. Armed with letters of introduction from Margaret Mead and Alan Lomax, he went to learn more about the Balkan folk dances that he loved. However, his mission changed when he found societies in rapid transition, and soon felt compelled to document the disappearing agrarian life-style and village culture. In this initial trip and on the dozen additional trips made between 1966 and 1987, he filmed, recorded, and photographed traditional music, dance, and ceremonies.</p>
								<p>These historic films, recordings, and black and white photographs memorialize a way of village life that has since been transformed by modernization, globalization and emigration.</p>

							<h1>History</h1>
							<p>Podkrepa began in 1939 in the home of Radi & Petia Cherkezov as a social gathering for Bulgarians and Macedonians new to the United States. Following the suggestion of Bishop Andrei, of Sofia, Bulgaria, on his visit to Portland, Podkrepa was registered with the State of Oregon as a fraternal organization.</p>
							<p>Within a year, the social organization grew from 25 to 93 official members (at that time, only men were listed as members but, counting women and children, total membership was roughly 250). Because of their size, the group started looking for a lot to build a community building on.</p>
							<p>They chose Podkrepa’s current location because many members lived nearby. In 1946, the first round of pledges to raise money for the land brought in $3,750. The lot was then purchased in 1950 and construction began. In 1952 the second round of funding collected $2,531 to build the building. Members and local businesses in the area, that were supported by the members, donated to Podkrepa. The members did as much as of the work as possible to help to keep costs down.</p>
							<p>On June 8, 1952 the current meeting hall on Killingsworth was dedicated with Rev Nicholas Levko, Pastor of Russian Orthodox church officiating.</p>
							<p>1950s the group decided to meet twice a month, once for business and the other purely social. Later, they opted for monthly meetings and a variety of special events. Podkrepa has grown, throughout the years, to include events like annual fundraising teas, holiday bazaars, folk dancing, concerts, holiday celebrations, other celebrations, frequent socials, and regular meetings. That format has continued to the present day.</p>
							<p>In 2011 Podkrepa officially became a non-profit charitable organization in the State of Oregon.</p>
